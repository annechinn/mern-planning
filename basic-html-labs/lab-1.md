# VS Code First Page

Boilerplate Code refers to sections of code that are often re-used, with little to no modifications. Every time we create a new HTML file, we need to add some boilerplate code. Fortunately, Visual Studio Code makes this very easy.

If you just add a "!" character and then the "Tab" key, the following HTML will be automatically added to your file.

```markup
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

### Adding First Content. Hello World!

Look for the body element. This is where the main content for the page goes. Add an h1 heading element \(we'll learn more about headings soon\) with the text "Hello World!".

```markup
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
```

### Viewing the Page

There are two ways to load the page in your browser.

1. **Drag the page to the browser window** - you need to refresh page as you make changes.  Open the Chrome browser, and then drag the file from the Visual Studio Code File Explorer onto the browser window and it should load the page.
2. **Use Live Server from VS Code** - automatically refreshes page as you make changes. Right click on the file and "Open with Live Server" will appear as top choice on menu. Select that option and and a new browser window should be launched with the page.

Here's what your page should look like in the browser.
