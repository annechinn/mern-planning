# Resume Progression - HTML

#### **Resume Assignment: Use what you've learned to create a resume with HTML.**

**Requirements:**

**Create a header containing your name**

**Use sub-headers \(H2s, H3s, etc\) to create the following sections: objective, skills, experience, education**

**Use paragraph elements to fill out these sections**

**Use list elements where it makes sense \(e.g. listing skills\)**

**Use bold and italics when/if it's appropriate to do so.**

**Add an image**

**Add a link to your GitHub account or website if you have one**

**Add a link to your LinkedIn account if you have one**

**Add a link to something else if you have neither**

**Bonus:**

**1. Make an image a clickable link**

**2. Add audio of your choice with a controller or autoplay turned on**

**\*Use stack overflow and W3Schools for help on how to do this. Hint: the process is similar to adding images**
