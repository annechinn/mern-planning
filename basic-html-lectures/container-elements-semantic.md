# Container Elements - Semantic

### Introduction of Semantic Container Elements

#### Post-HTML5 - Semantic Elements

With the release of HTML5 in 2008, a new set of semantic HTML elements were introduced. These are similar to the div and span elements, in that they are generic container elements, but they have the advantage that they give meaning to the content they contain.   

Now, instead of using div elements to organize the large chunks of content on the page, we have a new set of semantic HTML elements that replace a lot of the previous cases where we were using the div element.

This is useful for general code readability, but also there is the potential for them to be used by accessibility and search engines in the future.

Using these elements for the top-level large chunks of content are pretty obvious. But the rules for where to use each semantic element are not rigid, so you have to decide what makes sense for your application.  As you can see in the diagrams below, you can have nested header and footer elements.  I have included an article in the Resources section below that goes into some detail about some of the new elements and when to use each.
