The MERN Stack stands for **M**ongoDB **E**xpress **R**eact **N**ode. 

* **M**ongoDB ****is a database that runs on the back-end server.
* **E**xpress ****is a web application framework for building web services on the back-end. 
* **R**eact ****is a front-end library for building UI components. 
* **N**ode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment \(like a web browser\) that allows JavaScript to run on a web server. 



### Why MERN?

* Lots of jobs. It is the most in-demand front-end library/framework. 
* Back-end leverages JavaScript knowledge.
  * Only have to learn one programming language.
  * Web Services are written in JavaScript
  * MongoDB data format based on JavaScript object syntax.

#### 

#### Fundamentals

Learn the three core technologies upon which every web site depends.

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **HTML** | A _mark-up language_ to describe the content of web pages |
| **CSS** | A _stylesheet language_ used to express the presentation of web pages. |
| **JavaScript** | A programming language used for both front-end and back-end development. |

#### 

#### Front-end Web Developer 

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | An open-source library, built by Facebook, to easily build front-end components for web sites. |

#### 

#### Back-end Web Developer

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Node.js, Express.js** | Tools to build the web API \(Application Programming Interface\) which communicates with the front-end to deliver data back and forth. |
| **MongoDB** | Database to store application data |

#### 

#### Developer Tools

| Tool | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Git/GitHub** | The most popular source code version control system. |
| **Visual Studio Code** | The most popular source code editor. |

### Where you'll be by the end of this course?

* You will learn a lot in this course. Three months of challenging material that will give you a solid foundation to becoming a web developer.
* How strong your skills are at the end depends on how much time you have to put into practice what you learn and how deeply you engage with the material.
* If you work really hard, you will be in the home-stretch of what it takes to become a web developer. What will be left to learn, you can do through self-directing learning and building more projects to strengthen your skills and build your portfolio.



### How to benefit the most from the course

* Engage in learning: struggle, research, try again, struggle, research, try again, succeed.
* Learning is iterative - eventually it all starts to fit together and make sense, but you can feel overwhelmed at times along the way.
* Let me know when you don't get a concept
  * You're not dumb if you don't understand something, I'm just not explaining it well.
  * My job is to figure out how to present the information in a way that YOU understand.



### Which skills are the most important?

* JavaScript programming skills are essential, and the hardest part of what you'll learn in this course.
* If you're a strong programmer, that will carry you much further than any other skill.
* Prioritize front-end skills, before back-end. There is less to learn, and plenty of jobs. It is better to be strong in one area than spread too thin across the full stack.
